Customer transaction analytics &amp; risk insights


## 1) Project summary / problem statement (elevator pitch)

### Project title: Customer transaction analytics & risk insights — end-to-end ETL, analytics, and interactive Tableau Public dashboards.

### Problem statement: Banks and fintechs must monitor customer transactions to maximize lifetime value and minimize risk. This project uses transaction-level data to answer business questions such as:

• Who are our most valuable customers (by deposits & fees)?

• Where do fraud losses and risk concentrations exist?

• Which customer segments are likely to churn?

• Which merchant categories and channels drive revenue/growth or risk?

### Outcome/business value:

A single analytics pipeline and interactive dashboards that let product, risk, and finance teams explore revenue, transaction trends, risk (fraud), and customer health, enabling targeted retention campaigns, fraud mitigation, and more profitable product prioritization.


### Tools & Technology Stack
*   Jupyter Notebook: Used for initial data exploration, analysis, and prototyping.
*   Prefect: Orchestrates the ETL pipeline, ensuring reliable and repeatable data workflows.
*   dbt Core (with MySQL): Performs data transformations, cleaning, and modeling within the MySQL data warehouse.
*   MySQL: Serves as the primary data warehouse, storing both raw and transformed data.
*   Tableau Public: Creates interactive dashboards and visualizations for data exploration and presentation.
